Wx/Data
===============================

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

MORE INFO

Wx::Data makes it easier to create wxPerl data-aware controls.

Those controls are also filled in asynchrounously thanks to POE.

That means you have to use POE in your Wx application though.

Hopefully, more to come soon.

Thanks

Eriam
